# Welcome to the HPECM-Community wiki!
## Welcome
To start with this site is mostly about sample code for the .Net SDK.  It may become more than this depending on interest and time.

## Other resources
The .Net SDK documentation is available for version [83](http://sdk.hpecm.xyz/83/index.html) and [90](http://sdk.hpecm.xyz/90/index.html).
